**Project Euler - Problem 10**

https://projecteuler.net/problem=10

Euler 10 has been a favorite of mine for a long time. It's a complexity problem disguised as a math problem. I like that it contextualizes algorithmic complexity - an issue which is often taught in the abstract but isn't immediately meaningful to a beginning programmer.

If your solution isn't elegant, it won't run. Suddenly, complexity is a real concern. It's ruining your simple math problem.

I like to revisit Euler 10 every so often to see if I can improve my solution. This attempt, my most recent, is an implementation of a Sieve of Eratosthenes in Java. It was pair-programmed with [Galen White](https://github.com/msgalenwhite).

Its runtime is alright but I think there's some room for improvement in the nested loops on lines 22-23.
